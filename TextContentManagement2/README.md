Folder for TextContentManagement2 (2 for second attempt).

Goal:
Create a console application for library management with the following capabilities:
1) Add new books with information: title, author, year of publication, unique code of the book.
2) Delete a book by unique code.
3) Search for books by author or title.
4) Display all available books.
5) Borrow a book (change its status to "in use").
6) Return a book (change its status to "available").

Implementation details:
I) Data should be stored in a JSON file.
II) Use SOLID principles to organize code.
III) Use LINQ and appropriate collections (List<T>, Dictionary<TKey, TValue>, etc.) to process and aggregate data.
IV) A minimal console menu for selecting actions.

For GitHub: to create a folder, type "/" in the filename field and create a file (README.md for example).
